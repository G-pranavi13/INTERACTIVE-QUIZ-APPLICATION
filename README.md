##Quiz Application using JavaScript

This project is an interactive Quiz Application built with JavaScript that allows users to answer multiple-choice questions and receive instant feedback on their responses. The application dynamically presents questions one by one, tracks the userâ€™s progress, and validates answers in real time. Upon selecting an answer, users immediately know whether their choice was correct or incorrect, enhancing the learning experience.

The app is designed with a simple and responsive interface, making it accessible across devices. It can be extended to include features such as score tracking, timers, randomized questions, and result summaries. This project demonstrates practical use of JavaScript DOM manipulation, event handling, and conditional logic in building an engaging and user-friendly web application.
